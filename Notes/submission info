Hi,
After I clicked on the Facebook login and authorized the login and permissions, I did not see my information on the app.
Can you check to see if your app is working properly and then resubmit?

Your app's Facebook Login button does not work. Please make sure the provided test user can successfully and consistently log in with the Facebook Login button. See more about authentication. 



Other notes, your last notes say...
"After I clicked on the Facebook login and authorized the login and permissions, I did not see my information on the app.

I have verified, using another account, that My App will show the current user's info. 
And, using My App on my computer/server, I can still post to my business page with My App. Although, I will need to ask permissions (which is why i am here) for others to do the same.
